# AdminPage
2 different views for the admin page. One for the songs and one for the albums

# AddSongDialog

append means "to add something to the end of an existing structure". It's used to:

 1. Add new items to lists/arrays
 2. Add content to files
 3. Add data to form submissions (like in this code)

??? Why it's used here ???
1. Builds a multipart form that can contain:
  - Text fields (title, artist)
  - File uploads (audio, image)
2. Prepares for HTTP POST to the server
3. Structures data so the server understands each piece

Real-World Analogy
Imagine packing a box (FormData) for shipping:

- append is like putting labeled items in the box:

    - "Title" → "My Awesome Song" (text)
    - "AudioFile" → song.mp3 (file)
    - "ImageFile" → cover.jpg (file)
